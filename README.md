# LAMP-stack
This project included building and configuring a LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python) stack on Ubuntu.
I made a LAMP stack from scratch, which is a common software bundle/ stack that many popular web applications use.
First I built LAMP stack using PHP, then I switched to Python scripts as well. 
Building the stack involved working with a lot of Linux commands and bash scripts. 

The project involved:
1. Building and configuring a LAMP stack
2. Creating a working web server, and making use of a registered domain
3. Creating an SSL certificate(certbot) on Apache to provide security for online communications on my web server 
4. Creating a virtualhost 
5. Working with python scripts for backend webpage operations
6. Configuring PHP and setting up PHPmyadmin for handling MySQL database from a web browser. Next step involved securing it.
7. I also dabbled with SSH key-based authentication methods, which can be used to make my web application more secure.
8. I also tried out SFTP to securely transfer files to and fro the web server.

Alternative ways I could have done this project(and future directions): Hosting the LAMP stack on a cloud-based service. I also could have made a working dynamic web application such as a Discord or Netflix clone that could be launched on the web server.
